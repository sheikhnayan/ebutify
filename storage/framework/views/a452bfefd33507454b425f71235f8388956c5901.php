                            <p>WP ERP extensions require renewal of subscriptions every year, but you can choose whether to renew your subscription or
                            not. We suggest to renew your subscriptions because we are always improving our products and releasing new updates. A
                            valid subscription is required for receiving updates.</p>
                            <p>Please note that when you purchase any product using PayPal or Stripe, you create an automatic payment account. This
                            means both Pay Pal and Stripe records your information and prepares your payment account. This helps the payment
                            gateways to automatically charge from you to complete automatic payments.</p>
