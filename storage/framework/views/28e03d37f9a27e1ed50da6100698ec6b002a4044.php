                            <p>There are four major parts of accounting that an accounting management system helps you with. Now let’s get to know all
                            of them.</p>
                            <h3>1. General Ledger</h3>
                            <p>A general ledger is a record book containing all the transaction details of a company. They help you get the data of
                            every debit and credit transaction. These data include the date, description, amount, and other crucial information.</p>
                            <p>Even if you run a small business, manual collection, input, and calculation of these data can take a lot of time and
                            effort. However, an account management system can make it quite easy to maintain a general ledger.</p>
                            <h3>2. Accounts Receivable (AR)</h3>
                            <p>Accounts receivable is an account that stores the data of all the money that third parties owe to you. These third
                            parties can be customers, business affiliates, and even banks.</p>
                            <p>A business has a lot of account receivables to keep track of on day to day basis. These data can also be maintained
                            efficiently using proper account management software.</p>

                            <h3>3. Accounts Payable (AP)</h3>
                            <p>Accounts payable, also known as AP in short form is the money you owe to other businesses, customers, or banks. Managing
                            accounts payable is an essential task for accountants. But this repetitive and time-consuming task can also be handled
                            by computer-based accounting software.</p>
                            <h3>4. Banking and Cash Management</h3>

                            <p>Every business has to deal with numerous transactions over bank or cash. Imagine managing all these transactions with
                            just pen and paper! That’s how much work needs to be done by an accountant if this were to be done in the analog method.</p>
                            <p>Well, the easier way is to implement an account management system to simplify and reduce the time needed to store and
                            manage all the transactions.</p>

                            <p>It is not hard to guess that a lot of small business fails because of bad money management. When you have an accounting
                            management system in place, you can easily manage and track how the transactions are being made.</p>
                            <p>Furthermore, a small business often has fewer number employees and a low profit margin. Most of the time this means that
                            they can’t afford the luxury of having a team of accountants. However, with the help of an account management system,
                            you can easily do the job of four or five with just one accountant.</p>

                            <p>A large number of transactions forces large businesses to use accounting management systems. In the case of small
                            businesses, it is needed because they have access to less capital and manpower. Albeit for the latter type of business,
                            the accounting management system also has to be an affordable one.</p>
